        <div class="description1">My name is Bryan Schmidt, and I am a novice computer coder from Canada. I was born in Paraguay,
           but was raised in Canada. I also lived in Spain for 12 years, as my parents worked there. I have always loved technology
            and have had a knack for that sort of thing. In high school I was in charge of sound and lights for all the major
             productions they had, and after I graduated high school and started working, i had two jobs: the first was plasma
              cutting using a computer to input codes to cut the metal, and the second was robotic welding, which also had to do
               with inputting code into a computer for a robot to weld accordingly.
